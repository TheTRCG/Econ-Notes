The size of a firm is determined by:
- [[Economies of scale]] relative to market size
	- Large firms might only experience small [[Economies of scale|economies of scale]] compared to their size, since the extent may be limited by the industry they are in. This increases costs and firms may choose to stay small
- [[Diseconomies of scale]]
	- Larger firms may face higher costs due to poor organisation, [[x-inefficiency]] or because of high wage costs as a proportion of revenue
- [[Profit motive]]
	- By growing, firms gain increased profits, and can benefit from [[Economies of scale|economies of scale]]
- [[Owners]]
	- Managers and board members will be incentivised to grow their companies in order to increase their bonuses, salaries and dividends

**Public sector vs Private sector**
| Public sector                                    | Private sector                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Government has control of the industry           | The firm is left to the free market and private individuals                   |
| Natural monopolies, for example CEB in Sri Lanka | Incentives to operate efficiently as they need to produce what consumers want |
| Positive externalities                           | Lower prices due to competition                                               |
| Social welfare may be the main objective         | Profit driven                                                                 |

**Divorce of ownership from control**
- The principal-agent problem can be linked to the theory of [[asymmetric information]], wherein the agent makes decisions for the principal, but is inclined to act in their own interests
- Managers will prioritise bonuses, whereas shareholders will want to maximise dividends

### Business objectives
**Profit maximisation**
- Firms break even where $\text{TR} = \text{TC}$
- A firmsâ€™ profit is the difference between total revenue and total costs
- **A firm is said to be maximising profits when $\text{MC} = \text{MR}$ 
- Profits increase where $\text{MR}>\text{MC}$
- Firms choose to maximise because:
	- Increased wages and dividends for entrepreneurs
	- Retained profits act as a source of finance
	- Shareholders maximise gains in the short run
	- Provides a stable price if long run profit maximisation is achieved

**Revenue Maximisation**
- **Revenue maximisation occurs when** $\text{MR} = 0$

**Sales Maximisation**
- This is when firms aim to sell as much of their goods and services as possible without making a loss
- **A firm is said to be maximising sales when** $\text{AC} = \text{AR}$
- Sales maximisation can help increase market share by sacrificing short run profits for long run profits
