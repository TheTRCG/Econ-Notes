# IAL Econ Government Intervention
## Key Terms
- _Cap and trade schemes_ - schemes that set a limit on a particular type of pollution, and then issue pollution permits to the total of that limit, which can be bought and sold between firms that pollute
- _Pollution permit_ - the permit used in cap and trade schemes

- _Government failure_ - occurs when a government intervention leads to a net welfare loss compared to the free market solution
- _Public choice theory_ - theories about how and why public spending and taxation decisions are made
- _Rent-seeking_ - use of political power by an economic agent to influence the distribution of resources for their own benefit at the expense of others with no extra social welfare

## Government Interventions
__Indirect Taxes__
One way the government can correct market failure is through imposing indirect taxes.
![[A Levels/Economics/Unit 1/Graphs/IDTaxes.excalidraw.md]]

This can shift the supply curve to closer to the Marginal Social Cost of production, internalizing the negative externalities of the product, and maximizing social welfare.

However:
- They may be difficult to target and may be too large or too small, partly due to information failure on the part of the government
- Governments may use the indirect taxes to raise revenue as well as reduce market failure, those two objectives may conflict in terms of the size of the tax
- Taxes are unpopular, and may be politically unfavorable

__Subsidies__
Another way is through the use of subsidies. To internalize positive externalities of a product, and increase the quantity in the market close to the socially optimal level

However:
- They can also be too large or too small
- There can be conflict with other policy objectives, the subsidy has to be paid for, opportunity cost
- Subsidies can be difficult to remove, can only be removed when prices are falling due to other causes

__Maximum Prices__
Market failures can arise if consumers cannot afford to buy necessities. So the government can implement a maximum price or price ceiling below the market equilibrium to reduce the price, however the quantity supplied will then also fall and can lead to the creation of black markets to circumvent the maximum price.
If the maximum price is set above the free market equilibrium, there will be no effect on the market.

__Minimum Prices__
Some goods have significant negative externalities. Governments can correct the market failure using a minimum price or price ceiling above the equilibrium price. Reducing the quantity demanded at a higher price. However, the excess supply can be a problem if allowed to reenter the market, and can cause the creation of black markets.
If the minimum price is below the free market equilibrium, there will be no effect on the market

__Regulation__
Regulation is widely used to correct market failure. It can be used to close information gaps, by forcing firms to disclose information to their consumer.
Regulation can also be used to control externalities, and even prevent especially damaging activities
However:
- It's difficult to fix the right level of regulations to ensure efficiency
- Regulations do not discriminate between the different costs to achieve its desired affects
- Regulations are difficult to enforce

__Trade Pollution Permits__
Firms that are able to reduce their pollution successfully are able to sell their permits and earn money. The costs to the industry and society are lower than with regulation. 
However:
- It's difficult to measure the pollution of a firm, and it can be obfuscated.

__State Provision of Public Goods__
Because of the characteristics of non-rivalry and non-excludability, they will either not be provided by the market mechanism or will only be provided in small quantities, resulting in market failure.
![[A Levels/Economics/Unit 1/Graphs/Public Goods.excalidraw.md]]

Demand does not meet supply in the graph, so the government will usually step in to provide these goods directly and pay for them via taxes. State provision will be the vertical supply line.
However, direct provision can have disadvantages:
- It may lead to inefficient production, particularly if the government produces the good itself. Since the government may have no incentives to cut costs to a minimum
- The wrong mix of goods may be produced. Since there is no market mechanism for consumers to choose what they want, the government will not be pushed towards maximizing social satisfaction

__Provision of Information__
Information failure can be addressed by the government by utilizing advertising campaigns, or using regulations to force parties to release information publicly, labels on cigarette packets is an example.


## Government Failures
Government failure is when the government intervenes, but there is a net loss of economic welfare rather than a gain. So, when total social costs arising from the intervention are greater than the total social benefits that are created by that intervention, the government has failed

__Distortion of Price Signals__
Some types of government interventions change price signals in the market. If a government subsidizes a product then that product may not be efficiently supplied, instead relying on the subsidy. Very high minimum wages can create unemployment for low waged workers.

__Unintended Consequences__
A government action could have an unintended side consequence

__Excessive Administrative Costs__
Sometimes the administrative cost of correcting market failure is so large that it outweighs the welfare benefits from the correction of the market failure.

__Information Gaps__
Governments like any agent rarely possess complete information to base their decisions on. Projections of cost and benefits are often wrong for a project.

__Conflicting Objectives__
Governments often have conflicting objectives. Every decision that they make has an opportunity cost. So governments may not prioritize that which gives the largest economic welfare, instead they might prioritize their own benefits

__Maximizing Their Own Welfare__
Public choice theory suggests that politicians act in a way that maximizes their own utility. Instead of prioritizing for the whole economy, they may try to benefit their own voters. Politicians may also display rent-seeking behavior and use their position to earn bribes

__Market Versus Government Failure__
It is often assumed that market failure should be corrected by governments. If markets fail to provide public goods, then the government should step in. However, there are other views on both extremes of the government should never step in and that the government should always intervene. The truth is probably somewhere in the middle
