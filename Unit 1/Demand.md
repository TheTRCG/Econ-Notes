# IAL Econ Demand
## __Key Terms__
- _Conditions of demand_ - factors other than price, such as income or price of other goods, which lead to changes in demand and shifts in the demand curve
- _Consumer surplus_ - the difference between how much buyers are prepared to pay for a good and what they actually pay
- _Contraction of demand_ - when quantity demanded reduces because of higher prices, shown by a movement up the demand curve
- _Demand Curve_ - the line on a price/quantity diagram that shows the level of effective demand at any price
- _Demand or effective demand_ - the quantity purchased of a good at any given price, given that other factors of demand remain unchanged
- _Extension of demand_ - where quantity demanded for a good increases because its price falls, shown by a movement down the demand curve
- _Law of diminishing marginal utility_ - the utility of an additional product consumed decreased from the last product consumed
- _Shift in the demand curve_ - a movement of the demand curve to the left or right of the original caused by a change in demand
- _Underlying growth rate_ - the long-run average growth rate for an economy over a period of time

- _Elastic (demand)_ - PED is greater than 1, greater than proportional change in demand with a change in price, demand is perfectly elastic if PED is infinite
- _Inelastic (demand)_ - PED is less than 1, less than proportional change in demand with a change in price, demand is perfectly inelastic if PED is 0
- _Price elasticity of demand / own price elasticity of demand_ - the proportionate response of changes in quantity demanded to a proportionate change in price, $$
\frac{P}{Q_{D}}\times \frac{\Delta Q_{D}}{\Delta P} $$
- _Total expenditure_ - quantity bought multiplied by average price of the product
- _Total revenue_ - quantity bought multiplied by average price of the product
- _Unitary elasticity_ - where the value of price elasticity of demand is 1. The responsiveness of demand is proportionally equal to the change in price

- _Cross elasticity / cross-price elasticity of demand_ - a measure of the responsiveness of quantity demanded of one good to a change in price of another good. Percentage change in quantity demanded of one good divided by the change in price of the other good
- _Income elasticity of demand_ - a measure of the responsiveness of quantity demanded to a change in income. Percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in income.
- _Inferior goods_ - goods for which demand falls when income increases (negative IED)
- _Normal goods_ - goods for which demand increases when income increases (positive IED)
- _Substitutes_ - goods that can be replaced by another to satisfy a want. Substitutes have a positive CED with each other
- _Complements_ - goods that are purchased with other goods to satisfy a want. Complements have a negative CED with each other


## Demand
Demand in economics is the quantity of goods or services that will be bought at any given price over a period of time

The demand curve is downward sloping and shows the lower the price, the higher the quantity demanded (in most cases). Therefore, it shows effective demand, how many consumers can afford to and would buy at any given price and not how many buyers would like to buy with unlimited resources.



__Conditions for Demand__
Factors affecting demand:
- _Income_ - demand for a _normal_ good increases when incomes rise, _inferior_ goods have reduced demand when incomes increase
- _Price of other goods_ - the rise in price of a good will lead to a rise in demand for _substitute_ goods to replace that good
- _Changes in population_ - increases demand if more people are there to buy
- _Changes in fashion_
- _Changes in legislation_
- _Advertising_ - a powerful influence on consumer demand

__Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility__
The value, or utility, attached to consuming the last product bought falls as more units are consumed over a period of time.
This helps to explain why the demand curve slopes down. Since buyers are only willing to pay a low price for relatively high amounts purchased, but will pay higher prices if the quantity available is lower.

__Consumer Surplus__
![[A Levels/Economics/Unit 1/Graphs/Consumer Surplus.excalidraw.md]]
The difference between the value to consumers and what they actually pay


## Price Elasticity of Demand
$\rhd$ the proportionate change in demand due to change in prices
![[A Levels/Economics/Unit 1/Graphs/PED.excalidraw.md]]
For the inelastic and elastic lines, they are only part of a longer graph and are not inelastic or elastic throughout their whole length
The price elasticity for a rise in price is less than for a fall in price over the same range, it's ratio of difference into ratio of final.

__Determinants of PED__
- _Availability of Substitutes_ - the better the substitutes for a product, the higher the price elasticity is
- _Width of market definition_ - the more widely the market is defined, the fewer substitutes it will be likely to have
- _Time_ - the longer the period of time, the more price elastic the demand is. Since there's more time for consumers to change and adapt, in the short term they're locked owing to habits, lack of information and already having purchased goods utilizing the changed price good.

__PED and Total Revenue/Expenditure__
PED and changes in total revenue/expenditure are linked. Total revenue is what the seller receives, expenditure is what the consumer spends, due to taxes they are not the same usually, but can be assumed to be in this case.
If PED < 1, then an increase in price will result in an increase in total revenue despite a reduction in amount sold, since demand changed less than proportionally to price.
If PED > 1, then an increase in price will result in a reduction of total revenue, despite an increase in price, since demand changed more than proportionally to price.
If PED = 1, then a change in price will have no effect on the total revenue.

## Income and Cross Elasticity
__Income Elasticity of Demand__
The demand for a good will change if there is a change in consumer's income.
$$
\frac{\text{percentage change in quantity demanded}}{\text{percentage change in income}}
$$

$$
\frac{Y}{Q} \times \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta Y} \text{ or } \frac{\Delta Q}{Q} \times \frac{Y}{\Delta Y}
$$

__Normal and Inferior Goods__
![[A Levels/Economics/Unit 1/Graphs/NandIGoods.excalidraw.md]]

A normal good has a positive income elasticity of demand, an inferior good will have a negative income elasticity of demand

__Cross Elasticity of Demand__
$\rhd$ the proportionate response of the quantity demanded of one good to the proportionate change in another

$$
\frac{\text{percentage change in quantity demanded of X}}{\text{percentage change in price of Y}}
$$

_Substitutes_ - goods with a positive cross elasticity, a good can be replaced with the other good, so an increase in the price of one causes an increase in demand of the other
_Complements_ - goods that have a negative cross elasticity, goods that are demanded because it is used with another good, an increase in the price of one causes a reduction in the price of the other
_Unrelated goods_ - goods with a cross elasticity of 0, they are not affected by changes in the price of the other
