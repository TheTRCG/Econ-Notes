# __Economic Systems__
An economy has to resolve the basics problem of infinite wants and finite resources, therefore it has to resolve three factors:
1. What is to be produced?
2. How is it to be produced?
3. For whom is it to be produced?

The 'actors' in any economic system are of three types:
1. Individuals
2. Groups - firms, political parties, families etc.
3. Government

An economic system is a network of individuals, organizations and institutions that allocate resources. This is done via social and legal systems.

## __Allocation of Resources__
__The market mechanism__
$\rhd$ allocates resources by bringing together buyers and sellers who agree on a price for the product being sold (supply and demand)
__Planning__
$\rhd$ allocates resources through administrative decisions, when an entity makes decisions about how to distribute resources.

## __Types of Economy__
__Free market economies__
The majority of resources are allocated through markets rather than governments and planning, there are no examples of pure free market economies. The US and Hong Kong have a larger proportion of market allocation and are therefore known as 'free market economies'.
Most amount of consumer choice.
Greatest amount of quality and innovation due to competition and innovation, but big firms control the market and influence consumer choices.
Greatest efficiency in theory because otherwise firms would be driven out.
Greater levels of political freedom.
Higher levels of inequality.
Higher levels of risk.

__Mixed Economies__
More resources are allocated through government planning than in free market economies. Typically, between 40 and 60 percent of resources are allocated by the government and the free market.
This is differentiated from free markets by welfare benefits and healthcare.
Mixed economies tend to have a greater allocation of resources and have their healthcare system administered and financed.
Characteristics are between command and free.

__Command Economies__
Most resources are allocated by the state and the market mechanism only plays a small part.
Least amount of consumer choice.
Reduced incentives to innovate and be efficient.
Less inequality and birth-to-death group of services provided by the government.
Limited political freedoms to ensure control.
