# IAL Economics - Production Possibility Frontiers
__Key Terms__
- _Allocatively efficient_: occurs when social welfare is maximized. The distribution of resources is such that it is not possible to redistribute them without making someone worse off.
- _Capital goods_: goods used in the production of other goods, e.g. factories, offices, machines etc.
- _Consumer goods_: goods and services  that are used by people to satisfy their needs and wants.
- _Margin_: a point of possible change.
- _Production possibility frontier_: (alternatively: production possibility curve or boundary), shows the maximum potential level of output of one good given a level of output for all other goods in the economy.


The PPF shows the different combinations of economic goods that an economy is able to produce if all resources in the economy are fully and efficiently utilized.
_Scarcity_ - there are finite amounts of resources, and therefore a finite amount of production, if an economy utilizing all its resources wants to produce more of a good it will need to sacrifice some other. This is _opportunity cost_.

Production cannot be outside the curve, as the production of capital/consumer goods increases an increasing opportunity cost of the other type of good is incurred.

Economic growth can be expressed as an outward shift in the curve.

A reduction or improvement in the productive capacity of either fields on the axes causes a pivotal shift in the PPF.

__Consumption Versus Investment__
There is a conflict between consumption and investment, an economy can consume today and have the consumption benefits today, or invest in capital goods and increase the potential of the economy having greater benefit. Investment in capital goods causes economic growth in the long term.

__Efficiency__
On the PPF full utilization of available resources is expressed as a position on the line.

_Productive efficiency_ is when a given set of resources produces the maximum output (i.e. operating on the PPF line)
_Allocative efficiency_ is when social welfare is maximized, not all points on the line are allocatively efficient.
