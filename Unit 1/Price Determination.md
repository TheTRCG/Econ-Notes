# IAL Econ Price Determination
## __Key Terms__
- _Equilibrium price_ - the price at which there is no tendency to change because planned (or desired) purchases are equal to supply
- _Excess demand_ - demand is greater than supply
- _Excess supply_ - supply is greater than demand
- _Free market forces_ - forces in free markets that act to reduce prices when there is excess supply and raise prices when there is excess demand
- _Market-clearing price_ - the price at which there is neither excess demand nor excess supply, but where everything offered for sale is purchased

- _Incentive function_ - when changes in price encourage buyers and sellers to change the quantity they buy and sell
- _Rationing function_ - when changes in price lead to more or less being produced, so increasing or limiting the quantity demanded by buyers
- _Signalling function_ - when changes in price give information to buyers and sellers that influence their decisions to buy and sell

- _Ad-volorem tax_ - tax charged as a percentage of the value of the good
- _Incidence of tax_ - the tax burden on the taxpayer
- _Specific or unit tax_ - tax charged on volume
- _Subsidy_ - a grant given that lowers the price of a good, usually designed to encourage production or consumption of a good

## Market Equilibrium
__Equilibrium price__
Alternatively known as the market-clearing price. In a market if the price is low there is high demand and low supply so consumers bid and increase the price. If the price is too high, there is low demand and high supply, so firms will try to sell at a lower price.
The pressures which force the market towards the equilibrium point are the _free market forces_, but they are not the only force, government intervention, unions and other factors may have more influence than the market.
There is only one price where demand equals supply and is the equilibrium price.

__Changes in Demand and Supply__
A change in [[Demand]] or [[Supply]] causes a shift in those curves and a corresponding shift in the equilibrium price and quantity, since those are determined where those lines meet.

__Consumer and Producer Surplus__
If demand or supply shifts right, there will be an increase in both consumer and producer surplus, and vice versa.
Surplus is the left most area between the respective curve and the price level

__Desirability of Equilibrium Prices__
The equilibrium price is not necessarily the 'right' price in the market. Depends on what 'right' is, social welfare, economic efficiency, defense of the country. They can all require a different equilibrium to be maximized. 

## Functions of the Price Mechanism
__Price Mechanism__
Allocates resources between conflicting uses. Buyers demand good and seller's supply.

__Rationing Function__
Consumer wants are infinite, but resources are finite. One function of the price mechanism is to allocate the finite resources. If a good is scarce and there is a lot of demand, then prices will be high, and supply will be rationed to those buyers willing to pay a high enough price.

__Signalling Function__
A price of a good is a key piece of information to both buyers and sellers in the market. Prices occur as a result of market conditions and therefore act as a signal. Decisions about buying and selling are dependent on these signals

__Incentive Function__
Low prices encourage purchases since utility per dollar spent is higher and vice versa. Higher prices encourage firms to invest in more production, low prices discourage this, and a prolonged fall in prices may drive firms out of the market.


## Indirect Taxes and Subsidies
An indirect tax is a tax on expenditure, the two major indirect taxes are value added tax (VAT) and excise duties.
VAT is an ad-volorem tax, where tax charged increases in proportion to the value of the tax
Excise duties are a specific or unit tax, the amount of tax does not change with the value of the good but with the quantity, these are not the same as customs duties which are charged on imports

__Incidence of Tax and Revenue__
$\rhd$ who pays for the taxes, unlikely to fall totally on the consumers, the producers also pay a portion of the tax and not all the burden is on the consumers.

Producer incidence is given by the difference between the old price level and the price level at the previous supply curve, given the current equilibrium quantity.

Consumer incidence is given by the difference between the old price and the new price.

The proportion of tax incidence that falls on the consumer is dependent on the elasticity of supply and demand. If supply is elastic or demand is inelastic, then a greater proportion will be on the consumers. If supply is inelastic or demand is elastic, then a greater proportion will be on the producers. 

Government revenue is given by the quantity sold into the tax value or the difference in price level between before and after the tax.

__Subsidies__
A subsidy is given by the government to producers, and lowers the cost of production for the consumers, shifting the supply curve downwards and to the right.

The largest fall in price owing to subsidies will be when demand is inelastic or supply is elastic. If demand is elastic or supply is inelastic, there will be little change in the price, since producers will absorb the subsidy, allowing an increase in profits.
