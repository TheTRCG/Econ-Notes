# IAL Econ Market Failure
## __Key Terms__
- _Asymmetric information_ - when information is not shared equally between buyer and seller and one side has an advantage
- _Complete market failure_ - when a market fails to supply any of a good that is demanded, creating a missing market failure
- _Market failure_ where resources are inefficiently allocated due to imperfections in the working of the market mechanism
- _Missing market_ - where resources are inefficiently allocated due to imperfections in the working of the market mechanism
- _Partial market failure_ - when a market for a good exists, but there is too much or insufficient production of the good

- _Consumption externalities / external benefits of consumption_ - when the social costs of consumption are different from the private costs of consumption
- _Externality / spillover effect_ - the difference between social costs and benefits and private costs and benefits
- _Marginal analysis_ - focuses on small or incremental changes in an economic variable, such as cost or output
- _Marginal social and private costs and benefits_ - the social and private costs and benefits of the last unit either produced or consumed.
- _Negative consumption externalities_ - when social benefits are less than private benefits
- _Negative externality / external cost_ - exists if net social cost is greater than net private benefit
- _Negative production externalities_ - when social costs exceed private costs
- _Positive consumption_ - externalities where social benefits exceed private benefits
- _Positive externality / external benefit_ - exists if net social benefit is greater than private benefits
- _Positive production benefits_ - when social costs are less than private costs
- _Positive production externalities_ - when social costs are less than private costs 
- _Private cost / benefit_ - the cost or benefit of an activity to an individual economic unit
- _Production externalities / external benefits of production_ - when the social costs of production are different from the private costs of production
- _Social cost_ - the cost of an activity to society as a whole, including all private costs and other costs as well

- _Free rider_ - a person or organization that receives benefits that others have paid for without making any contributions
- _Non-excludability_ - once provided, it is impossible to prevent any economic agent from consuming the good
- _Non-rejectability_ - once provided, it is impossible for any economic agent not to consume the good
- _Non-rivalry, non-diminishibility, non-exhaustabillity_ - consumption by one economic agent does not reduce the amount available for consumption by others
- _Private goods_ - goods that possess the characteristics of rivalry (once consumed, it cannot be consumed by anyone else) and excludability (it is possible to prevent someone else from consuming the good)
- _Public goods / pure public goods_ - goods that possess the characteristics of non-rivalry (or non-diminishibility) and non-excludability (includes non-rejectability)
- _Quasi-public goods / non-pure public goods_ - a good that does not perfectly possess the characteristics of a public good or a private good

- _Imperfect information_ - where buyers or sellers or both lack information to make an informed decision
- _Information failure / information gap_ - where buyers or sellers or both do not have the information that is available to make a decision
- _Moral hazard_ - when an economic agent makes a decision in their own best interest knowing that there are potential negative risks, and that if there are problems, the cost will be paid by other agents
- _Principal-agent problem_ - occurs when the goals of principals those who would gain or lose from a decision, are different from agents, those making decisions on behalf of the principal

- _Asymmetric information_ - where one party to a trade has more information than the other
- _Market bubble_ - occurs when rising demand drives prices beyond the level that might normally be expected
- _Speculation_ - buying or selling something in the expectation of a future price change and a profit
- _Too big to fail_ - when the cost to the economy is so great that the government cannot allow it to happen

## Externalities
Externalities arise when private costs and benefits are different from social costs and benefits. 
If social cost is greater than private cost, then a negative externality exists, typically overproduced by the free market
If social benefit is greater than private benefit, then a positive externality exists, typically under produced by the free market

__Externalities of Production and Consumption__
- Negative production externalities occur when social costs are greater than private costs in production
- Positive production externalities occur when social costs are less than private costs in production
- Positive consumption externalities are when social benefits are greater than private benefits for consumption
- Negative consumption externalities are when social benefits are less than private benefits in consumption

__Market Failure__
The price mechanism allocates resources. If the market prices do not accurately reflect the costs and benefits to society of economic activity, then resources will be misallocated. The greater the externality, the greater the market failure.

__Marginal Costs, Benefits and Welfare__
The difference between social costs and benefits changes as the level of output changes. This can be shown via marginal analysis. If the production and sale of a good does not account for its societal benefits there will be a loss in welfare.

![[A Levels/Economics/Unit 1/Graphs/MPCMSC.excalidraw.md]]

Where private cost is less than social cost. Production will take place where MPC = MPB, but the socially optimal level of output is where MSC = MSB, if the free market is left to operate there will be a deadweight loss of welfare

![[MSBMPB.excalidraw]]

When private benefits are less than social benefits. Production will take place where MPB = MPC, but socially optimal level of output is where MSC=MSB, if the free market is left to operate there will be a deadweight loss of welfare



## Under-provision of public goods
Nearly all goods are private goods, and are rivalrous. Consumption of that good leads to less available for others' consumption.
A few goods are public goods, which have characteristics of:
- Non-rivalry - does not reduce the amount available for consumption by another person if consumed
- Non-excludability - no person can be prevented from benefitting, and no one can opt out of receiving the good

Some examples of pure public goods are clean air, defense, police, street lighting.

__The Free Rider Problem__
If the provision of public goods were left to the free market, there would be market failure. Since people can't be prevented from utilizing the public good, there will be little incentive for people to pay for it. So a government needs to force the payment of taxes for public goods
The free rider problem can be somewhat solved by quasi public goods, which will restrict the usage of the good to people who are willing to contribute

## Imperfect Markets
An imperfect market has decisions based in imperfect information. Which means that there is an information gap.

Asymmetric information, is when one part has more information than the other and uses that to exploit the other. Asymmetric information can lead to a misallocation of resources and market failure.
Which can be found in advertising, financial institutions, and people not saving enough for pensions.

## Moral Hazard
When an individual or an organization is protected from the consequences of their actions. They are aware that someone else with deal with any problems that occur, and are not incentivized to take precautions and act sensibly. Free public healthcare means people might be less likely to look after themselves than those who have to pay for health treatment. It can be argued that welfare benefits prevent some from actively seeking work.

## Speculation
Speculation means an agent buys or sells something in the expectation of a future price change in the hope of making a profit. Occasionally the speculative motive is all one way and a bubble is created, everyone tries to buy, and the value keeps rising which adds to an upward pressure on the price causing traders to buy more, this is at risk of a sudden collapse causing dramatic price losses and leaving some traders with large losses
