# IAL Econ Supply
## __Key Terms__
 - _Conditions of Supply_ - factors other than price, such as income or the price of other goods, that lead to changes in supply and are associated with shifts in the supply curve
- _Long run_ - the period of time in which all factor inputs can be varied but the state of technology remains constant
- _Price elasticity of supply_ - a measure of the responsiveness of quantity supplied to a change in price. Percentage change in quantity supplied divided by percentage change in price
- _Producer surplus_ - the difference between the market price the firms receive and the price at which they are prepared to supply
- _Short run_ - the period of time when at least one factor input to the production process can be varied
- _Supply_ - the quantity of goods that suppliers are willing to sell at any given price over a period of time

## Supply
Supply is the quantity of goods that sellers are prepared to sell at any given price over a period of time.
If the price of a good increases, we can expect that producers will expand production to take advantage of higher prices and the potential higher profits.
So a supply curve with price and quantity is upward sloping
This assumes that:
- Firms are motivated to produce by profit, so this model does not apply to most of what the government produces
- The cost of producing a unit increases as output increases (marginal cost rises)

__Conditions of Supply__
Factors that can influence supply other than price
- _Costs of production_ - if the COP increases or reduces, there will be a leftward and up or a rightward and down shift in the supply curve, respectively. At any given level of output, firms will charge higher or lower.
- _Technology_ - If new technology is introduced there will be a reduction in the COP, greater productive efficiency and the supply curve will shift down or right. Due to natural disasters or conflicts, the inverse might happen
- _Prices of other goods_ - changes in the prices of other goods can affect the supply of a particular good, example, higher wood prices leads to less farmland utilized for crops, higher cost of agriculture
- _The goals of sellers_ - if there is a change in the profit levels that a seller expects to receive, then there will be a change in supply, revenue maximization vs profit maximization
- _Government legislation_ - taxes, regulations, removal of legal barriers can have an effect on supply
- _Expectations of future events_ - if firms expect a certain change in future prices, they may act accordingly. If higher prices are expected, current supply may be restricted to stockpile products
- _Weather_ - in agricultural markets this affects supply
- _Producer cartels_ - in some markets, producing entities may collaborate to reduce supply and artificially raise prices (OPEC)

__Factors of Production__
Labor, land, capital, and entrepreneurship (risk taking)

__Producer Surplus__
![[A Levels/Economics/Unit 1/Graphs/Producer Surplus.excalidraw.md]]

The difference between the market price and the price at which the firm is willing to supply. Area above supply line and below price level

__Price Elasticity of Supply__
The responsiveness of quantity supplied to changes in price

$$
\frac{\text{percentage change in quantity supplied}}{\text{percentage change in price}}
$$

$$
\frac{P}{Q_{s}}\times \frac{\Delta Q_{s}}{\Delta P}
$$

For a straight line passing through the origin, the elasticity is 1, horizontal has infinite elasticity and vertical 0.
For a line with positive intercept, E>1 and vice versa

__Determinants of PES__
- _Availability of substitutes_ - producer substitutes are goods that the producer can make as alternatives, example alternative crops for a farmer.
- _Time_ - the shorter the time period, the harder it is for producers to change the amount produced or to switch products, so more inelastic in the short term. Some items take a long time to produce (e.g. crops), spare capacity may be currently limited, some products are impossible to store

__Short and Long Run__
In microeconomics these have precise definitions
- _Long run_ - all factors of production in making a good are variable
- _Short run_ - at least one factor of production is fixed.
