# AL Econ - Consumer Behavior and Demand - Rational Decision-Making
## __Key Terms__
_Behavioral Economics_ - a branch of economics that looks at why economic agents are not always rational
_Default_ - to fail to pay money owed at the right time
_Economic welfare_ - the level of well-being or prosperity or living standards of an individual or group of individuals, such as a country
_Homo-economicus_ - the rational human used by economists when constructing, explaining and verifying models. 
_Macroeconomics_ - the study of the economy as a whole, including inflation, growth and unemployment
_Microeconomics_ - the study of the behavior of individuals or groups, such as consumers, firms or workers, typically within a market context
_Neoclassical theory_ - a theory of economics that typically uses the assumption that economic agents will maximize their benefits and act perfectly rationally, and uses it to develop how resources will be allocated and the forces of demand and supply.
_Utility_ - the satisfaction or benefit from consuming a good

## __Rational Economic Decision-Making__
A Level microeconomics is based on neoclassical theory, and assume that economic agents make decisions rationally to maximize their net benefits.

## __Maximization__
_Consumers_ - Expected to maximize their economic welfare, which is measured by utility. Consumers are expected to compare the utility of consuming an additional unit of a product versus the opportunity cost.

_Workers_ - Expected to maximize their own welfare at work. Pay, job security, satisfaction, cost of alternate employment are all factors.

_Firms_ - Owners expected to maximize their reward from ownership. Therefore, firms will aim to maximize their profits.

_Governments_ - Assumed to want to maximize welfare of citizens.

These goals are oversimplified, large firms have management who often have different goals, governments can be corrupt, people are irrational.

__The Margin__
One of the key elements of neoclassical theory is to assume that decisions are made at the margin. It is assumed that there is a judgement made of the cost of the next unit, not the past units.

## __Behavioral Economics__
The homo-economicus model is incorrect, behavioral economics attempts to address this issue by acknowledging irrationality.
_The influence of other people's behavior and the need to feel valued_ - decisions of consumers are affected by social norms and their peers.
_Habitual behavior and inertia_ - once a consumer has a habit it is a considerable amount of effort to change it, most people are satisfied with the status quo.
_Consumer weakness at computation_ - no quick math. Often exploited by firms.
_Framing and bias_ - economic statements or choices can often be framed in a way to influence the outcome, often used by marketers and politicians.
