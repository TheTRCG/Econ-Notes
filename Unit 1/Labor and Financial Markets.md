## __Specialization__
$\rhd$ the production of a limited range of goods by an entity so that in collaboration with others a complete range of goods is produced.

Specialization can be between countries, and globalization is speeding up specialization between countries.

Specialization between individuals is _division of labor,_ Adam Smith proposed it with pin makers in Wealth of Nations. He noted a substantial increase in productivity due to an increase in labor productivity and capital productivity.
- Specialization enables workers to gain skills in a narrow range of tasks. Enabling far more productivity than if responsible for a range of tasks.
- Cost-effective to provide specialized tools since its usage would be maximized, example tractors for farmers.
- Time is saved since workers aren't moving around or switching equipment.
- Workers can specialize in tasks best suited to them.

There are limits to specialization, if work is divided too much it can become and tedious and monotonous, resulting in poorer quality of work and less output. The size of the labor market will also limit the ability to specialize. An economy will also find it difficult to adapt and change if they are overspecialized.

## __Sectors of the Economy__
Three main sectors:
- _Primary_: raw material extraction and agriculture. 
- _Secondary_: raw materials being processed into goods.
- _Tertiary_: provides services

Most firms tend to operate in one of these sectors, but some big ones operate across multiple sectors.

Additionally, can be split along:
- _Public Sector_: the state or government sector of the economy.
- _Private Sector_: the part of the economy owned by private entities.

# __Markets__
Markets are any set of arrangements by which buyers and sellers trade goods.
Submarkets are markets within larger markets, for example diesel fuel in Brazil is a submarket of the fuel market.

## __Money__
Specialization requires exchange because otherwise a specialized worker cannot ensure their service or product can be exchanged for the other goods they need to survive. Bartering is cumbersome in modern society, so money is used.

_A medium of exchange_: in order to barter, there needs to be a double coincidence of wants. This disincentivises trade and therefore specialization, causing little increase in the standard of living. Money separates the entities, providing a common medium of exchange that can be used for any good.

_A measure of value_: Money acts as a unit of account. If something has twice the cost in money of another, we know its value is then twice that of the latter. Money allows people with differing opinions on the value to reach a consensus and trade.

_A store of value_: A worker will not immediately spend their wages. They may delay since it is more convenient to spend later or to save. This can only be done if what can be purchased in the present and the future is approximately the same. Therefore, money links the present and future. Hyperinflation destroys this link.

_A method of deferred payment_: Entities will lend if they believe that what they get back will be worth roughly the same, since money links the past and future. When money ceases to have this connection, lending will collapse.

## __Forms of Money__
_Cash_: Notes and coins. They are token (symbolic) money, and have little or no intrinsic value. The government enforces the acceptability of cash by making it legal currency. That means by law it must be accepted.
The higher the rate of inflation, the less it can be said that cash is a 'good' money.

_Money in current accounts_: banks offer current accounts which can have cash withdrawn from the account at any time, along with the provision of a debit card and check book providing additional mediums of exchange. Current account deposits are nearly as good as cash.

_Near monies_: assets that fulfil some but not all the functions of money, they act as measures and stores of value but are not easily used as mediums of exchange. The ease by which an asset can be converted into money without loss of value is called liquidity. An example would be time deposits with savings banks.

_Non-money financial assets_: all financial assets can be turned into cash, but most assets have significant penalties for doing so, with long waiting times and considerable loss of money from conversion. This is not money. Shares are an example, they are easy to sell but take up to a month to receive the money, along with loss of value, shares are also volatile and not good stores of value or as methods of deferred payment.

_Money Substitutes_: Money is not the only means of payment for goods and services. Credit cards have become an increasingly important medium of exchange. A possession of a credit card does not show that the person has money in their account (does not store value), it only represents an ability to borrow money instantly, therefore it is a money substitute.

# __Financial Markets__
$\rhd$ any convenient set of arrangements allowing the trade of services or assets that are monetary in nature. Financial markets exist for the buying and selling of land, labor and capital by allowing entities to obtain credit for those purchases.
Financial markets also allow participants to speculate and realize financial gains. 
The combination of speculation and delivery of genuine services means financial markets are prone to regular crises that can cause significant damage to the real economy.

 __The Role of Financial Markets__
_To Facilitate Savings_: makes money better suited to be a store of value and be used in the future, and enables entities to make big ticket purchases.
_To make funds available to businesses and individuals_: loans can be given at a profit by an institution to entities who can use that to finance themselves.
_To facilitate the exchange of goods and services_: Financial institutions play a vital role in creating payment systems, for example bureau de changes buy and sell foreign currency and transfer money between bank accounts in different countries.
_Provide forward markets_: Forwards markets exist for food commodities and for other hard commodities, and for foreign exchange, financial institutions provide a way for entities to buy and sell forward.
_Provide a market for equities_: Equities are shares of a company. Issuing shares, or equity finance, can be used to facilitate a firms' expansion. Stock markets provide a way for owners of shares to trade shares making them more liquid.
