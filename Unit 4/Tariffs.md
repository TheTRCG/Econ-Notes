TODO: Insert tariff graph here


### Welfare analysis of a tariff
- Consumer surplus falls by ($A+B+C+D$) as the tariff raises world price
- Producer surplus rises by ($A$) as the revenue per unit rises
- Imports are taxed, causing tax revenue to increase by ($C$)
- Overall, there is a welfare **loss** of ($B+D$): this is known as deadweight loss
