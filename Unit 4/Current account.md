The current account measures:
1. Balance of trade in goods
2. Balance of trade in services
3. Primary income
4. Secondary income

### Causes of a current account imbalance
A current account imbalance could be when there is either a current account deficit **or** surplus.
- The China effect, wherein cheaper imports from countries like China increase the demand for imports, increasing import expenditure
- Loss of comparative advantage
- Appreciation of the exchange rate, which means the currency is overvalued, reducing the relative price of imports and increasing the currency outflow
- High [[Inflation|inflation]]
- Lack of natural resources

### Methods to reduce a current account deficit
There are three main types of policies to improve a current account;
1. Expendinture reducing policies
	- Interest rates
		- Increasing the interest rate increases the cost of borrowing
		- This makes credit less accessible and reduces loans
		- We see a fall in consumption, which shows a decreased demand for imports
	- Income tax
		- By increasing income tax citizens have less disposable income, which reduces their _purchasing power_
		- As purchasing power falls, consumption decreases, as does the marginal propensity to import
2. Expenditure switching policies
	- Tariffs
		- Increasing tariffs increases the price of imports
		- This reduces the demand for imports as they become more expensive
	- Government spending
		- By increasing government expenditure, export production can be subsidized
		- This reduces the cost of production for firms, which can inturn reduce export prices
		- As export prices decrease, exports become more competitive and export demand increases, raising export volume
	- Currency devaluation
		- By [[Exchange rates|increasing currency supply]], the value of the currency falls
		- This makes exports more competitive by reducing their relative price
		- This also makes imports more expensive, reducing import demand
		- **However**, this strategy has its limitations - see the J-curve effect
3. Supply side policies
	- Increased spending on education
	- Corporate tax cuts
	- Privatization and deregulation to promote competition
	- Increased spending on infrastructure

### The J-curve effect
For a currency devaluation to be effective, the PED for ($\text{X}+\text{M}$) must be elastic.
- In the short run, where PED for $\text{X}$ is inelastic, the devaluation of the currency only causes a less than proportionate increase in demand, reducing export revenue
- Where PED for $\text{M}$ is inelastic(short run), the increase in price due to the devaluation of currency only causes a _less than proportionate_ increase in demand, **reducing** export revenue
- In the long run, PED for ($\text{X}+\text{M}$) becomes elastic, therefore the devaluation can cause export revenue to rise

The J-curve effect shows that a currency devaluation will worsen the current account deficit in the short run before it gets to improve.
