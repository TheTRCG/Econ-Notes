Terms of trade are a measure of the rate of exchange of one product for another when two countries trade.

Economic theory suggests that comparative advantage alone does not determine a country's decision to trade. _Trade is dependant on the terms of trade between partners._

$\text{Terms of trade} = \frac{\text{Index of export prices}}{\text{Index of import prices}} \times 100$

### Favorable terms of trade
- Export prices rise relative to import prices
- Import prices fall relative to export prices
- With a given volume of exports, a country can purchase more units of imports
### Unfavorable terms of trade
- Export prices fall relative to import prices
- Import prices rise relative to export prices
- To be able to purchase the same amount of imports, export volume needs to increase
