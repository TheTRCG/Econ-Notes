Specialization is when nations are not self sufficient but rather choose to concentrate on producing certain goods/services and trading the surplus with other economies.
- Absolute advantage exists when a country is able to produce a good for less in absolute terms than another country (greater total output)
- Comparative advantage exists when a country able to produce a good/service at a lower _opportunity cost_ than another country.
- The theory of comparative advantage states that countries will find it mutually advantageous to trade if the opportunity cost of production of goods differ.

### Calculating an absolute advantage
|          |Total output |     |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| Country  | Wheat | Olive Oil | 
| Spain    | 20    | 100       |
| Portugal | 30    | 120       |       

Here we can see that Portugal has an absolute advantage in the production of both goods.

|          | Cost per unit in worker hours |           |
|----------|-------------------------------|-----------|
| Country  | Wheat                         | Olive Oil |
| Spain    | 10                            | 15        |
| Portugal | 20                            | 10        |

In the table above, assume that both countries use _60_ worker hours in the production of goods.
Then, we calculate the output produced by each country $\frac{Cost per unit}{Output}$, which shows us:
- Spain produces 6 units of wheat or 4 units of olive oil in 60 worker hours.
- Portugal produces 3 units of wheat or 6 units of olive oil in 60 worker hours.

Based on these calculations, we can determine that Spain has an absolute advantage in the production of wheat while Portugal has an absolute advantage in the production of olive oil.

### Calculating a comparative advantage

*For the exam, remember that David Ricardo conceptualized the idea of comparative advantage*

A country can be said to have a comparative advantage if it can produce a good/service at a lower opportunity cost compared to a trading partner. **Trade will only be beneficial if the opportunity costs differ.**

|          | Cost per unit in worker hours |           |
|----------|-------------------------------|-----------|
| Country  | Wheat                         | Olive Oil |
| Spain    | 15                            | 30        |
| Portugal | 10                            | 15        |

**Wheat:**      
_Spain_ = $\frac{15}{15} : \frac{30}{15}$  = $1 : 2$
_Portugal_ = $\frac{10}{10} : \frac{15}{10}$ = $1 : 1.5$
**Olive oil:**      
_Spain_ = $\frac{30}{30} : \frac{15}{30}$ = $1 : 0.5$
_Portugal_ = $\frac{15}{15} : \frac{10}{15}$ = $1 : 0.67$

Therefore, the comparative advantage for wheat lies with Portugal ($1 : 1.5$), and the comparative advantage for olive oil lies with Spain ($1: 0.5$).
Portugal will specialize in the production of wheat, and Spain will specialize in the production of olive oil.

### Advantages of specialization
- Increase in total output due to economies of scale
	- Average cost decreases
- Increased foreign exchange due to increased trading
- Competitiveness increases
	- $AD\uparrow \;\;\longrightarrow\; Exports\uparrow$

### Disadvantages of specialization
- Overdependance on imports leaves economies vulnerable to shock pricing
- Overdependance on export demand as countries may lose their comparative advantage
- Structural unemployment
- Environmental damage due to exploitation of natural resources
- Trade imbalances
