A group of countries that have signed an agreement to reduce or eliminate tariffs, quotas, and other protectionist measures between themselves.

Trade blocs can be of the following types:
1. [[Free trade areas]]
2. [[Customs unions]]
3. [[Common markets]]
4. [[Monetary unions]]

Examples of trade blocs:
- European Union - 27 members as of 2021
- North American Free Trade Agreement - USA, Canada, Mexico
- Association of South East Asian Nations - 10 member state from SEA
- Comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans-pacific partnership - 11 members as of 2018

### Trade creation with blocs
- Trade creation is said to take place when a country moves from buying goods from a high cost country to buying them from a lower cost country
- The trade creation effect is most likely to be seen inside the trade bloc as countries with a [[Specialization & Comparative advantage|comparative advantage]] will benefit from higher demand

### Trade diversion with blocs
- Trade diversion takes place when a country moves from buying goods from a low cost producer to buying them from a higher cost producer
- The trade diversion effect is seen because blocs place tariffs on non-member states
