TODO: Quota graph

### Welfare analysis of a quota
- Consumer surplus falls by ($A+B+C+D$) as the tariff raises world price
- Producer surplus rises by ($A$) as the revenue per unit rises
- Importers gain revenue of ($C$) as they retain previous orders within the quota
- Overall, there is a welfare **loss** of ($B+D$): this is known as deadweight loss
