- Income refers to a "flow" concept as it is accumulated regularly
- **Income inequality** refers to the unequal distribution of income between individuals
- Wealth refers to a "stock" concept as it is accumulated through physical assets (houses, pensions)
- **Wealth inequality** refers to the difference in the value of the stock of assets owned by individuals

### Measuring inequality
- The Lorenz Curve is a graphical representation of the degree of income or wealth inequality in an economy

TODO: Insert Lorenz Curve here

1. The horizontal axis shows the cumulative percentage of households
2. The vertical axis shows the cumulative percentage of income
3. The 45 degree line shows a position of **total equality**
4. _The Lorenz Curve is **always** drawn below the 45 degree line_

### Calculate the Gini coefficient with the Lorenz Curve
$\text{Gini coefficient} = \frac{\text{Area A}}{\text{Area A}+\text{Area B}}$ 
The higher the coefficient, the more unequal the distribution of income is.

### Income inequality within countries
Since the 1980's income inequality has been rising. This has been seen in both developed and emerging economies.
1. The impact of globalization
	- Offshoring
	- Migration of workers
	- Automation of labor
2. Technological advances
	- Demand for skilled labor has increased
	- Skill premium in wages
	- Low skilled labor has been replaced by machinery
3. Labor market deregulation
	- Reduction in trade union power
	- Abolition of the minimum wage
4. Rise of the 1%

### Consequences of rising income inequality
- Life expectancy falls as the standard of living falls
- Savings ratio increases and consumption falls
- Entrepreneurship falls as it is harder to accumulate funds
	- However, motivation to break out of poverty increases
- Migration increases
