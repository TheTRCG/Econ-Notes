Globalization refers to the ever increasing integration of the worlds local, regional and national economies into a single international market.

Since the 1950's, the rate of economic integration between world economies has accelerated

### Factors contributing to globalization
- The internet
- Increased foreign direct investment (e.g. outsourcing labor)
- Air travel
- Trading blocs (e.g. free trade areas like the EU)
- Container shipping

### Disadvantages of globalization
- It is hard for local brands to compete with cheaper imports
	- This can hinder internal economies and limit growth
- Exploitation of labor
	- Big firms outsource production to countries with lax labor laws and exploit workers, paying low wages and providing inhumane working conditions (e.g. Bangladesh)
- Pollution
	- Firms exploit natural resources and don't plan for the future
	- Waste material is not disposed of properly, at the expense of the local communities (e.g. Coca Cola factories in Sri Lanka)
- Governments lose out on tax revenue
	- Many countries incentivize FDI's by offering tax exemptions in exchange for moving production processes there, meaning that governments lose out on potential tax revenue.
	- There are also countries like Monaco and Switzerland which are "tax havens" where companies hold their assets without having to pay taxes to their own governments.
