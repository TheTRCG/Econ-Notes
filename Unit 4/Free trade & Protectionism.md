Trade liberalization refers to a move towards greater free trade through the removal of trade barriers.

An extreme form of free trade is [[Trading Blocs|trading blocs]]

### Advantages of free trade
- Economic growth
	- Export volume increases, causing export revenue to increase
	- This is an injection to the [[Circular flow of income|circular flow of income]], which triggers a [[The multiplier effect|positive multiplier effect]], increasing AD and thereby increasing real GDP
	- Export demand also increases as the global economy grows
	- As global export supply increases, the price of imports falls, reducing the price of raw materials, reducing the cost of production for firms
- Standard of living increases
	- Countries specialize and achieve [[Economies of scale|economies of scale]], and the demand for labor increases, reducing unemployment and improving the standard of living
- Increased foreign direct investment
	- Investment is an injection to the [[Circular flow of income|circular flow of income]], which triggers a [[The multiplier effect|positive multiplier effect]], increasing AD and thereby increasing real GDP 
	- Investment also increases labor demand, reducing unemployment
- Improved [[current account]]
	- As net exports increase, export revenue increases, improving the [[current account]] of an economy

### Disadvantages of free trade
- [[Demand-pull inflation]]
	- As export volume increases, and the positive multiplier kicks in, AD increases, raising the price level and causing demand-pull inflation
- Free trade is only beneficial if the economy has a comparative advantage
	- If countries export less than they import, they have a trade imbalance and will end up spending more on imports than they bring in via exports, which is a leakage from the [[Circular flow of income|circular flow of income]]. This triggers a [[The multiplier effect|negative multiplier effect]] and can lead to reductions in economic growth and a worsening [[current account]]
- Pollution and environmental damage
- Government revenue falls due to lost import taxes*

Protectionism refers to a state where a country implements trade barriers in an attempt to reduce the volume of trade.

In order to regulate the amount of trade within an economy, governments may impose the following trade restrictions;
1. [[Tariffs]] - a tax on imported goods, also known as customs duty or import tax
2. [[Quotas]] - these are physical limits on the quantity of goods that can be imported, and are a form of physical control
3. Export subsidies - grants given to firms by governments to reduce their cost of production
4. Administrative barriers - product standards that are intentionally different from other countries to increase costs for importers
5. [[Exchange rate manipulation]] - in some cases, governments may lower the exchange rate to make imports more expensive
