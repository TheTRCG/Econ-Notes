Aggregate demand is the total demand within an economy. It measures spending on goods and services by consumers, firms, the government and overseas consumers and firms.

$$\text{AD} = \text{C}+\text{I}+\text{G}+\text{(X}-\text{M)}$$
#### Consumer spending
This is how much consumers spend on goods and services. This is the **largest component of AD** and therefore is the most significant to economic growth. It makes up over 60% of [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]].

Disposable income is the amount of income consumers have left over after taxes and social security charges have been removed. It is what consumers choose to spend.

Consumer income might come from wages, savings, pensions, benefits and investments(dividend payments).

**Influences on consumer spending**
- Interest rates
	- If interest rates fall, cost of borrowing reduces and the incentive to save falls, while the incentive to consume increases
	- However there are significant time lags between the change in interest rates and the rise in AD
- Consumer confidence
- Marginal propensity to consume (MPC)
- Marginal propensity to save (MPS)
$$\text{MPC}+\text{MPS}=1$$
#### Capital investment
This accounts for around 15~20% of GDP, and around ¾ of this comes from private sector firms.

**Influences on investment**
- The rate of economic growth
	- High growth → High investment
- Businesses confidence and expected returns
- Demand for exports
- Interest rates
- Access to credit
- Corporate tax

#### Government spending
This accounts for 18~20% of GDP. Transfer payments are not included in this figure as no output is derived from them. Government spending is the third largest component of AD.

**Influences on government expenditure**
- Economic growth
	- During recession, government spending might increase in an attempt to stimulate the economy
	- During periods of growth, governments will receive more tax revenue as consumption is higher. The size of the budget deficit might decrease
- Fiscal policy
	- During periods of decline(recession), governments might use *expansionary fiscal policy*. This involves boosting AD and reducing taxes
	- During periods of growth, governments might use *contractionary fiscal policy*.

#### Exports and Imports
This is the value of the [[Current account|current account]] on the balance of payments. A positive value indicates a surplus, whilst a negative value indicates a deficit. This is the second largest component of AD.

**Influences on trade balance**
- Exchange rates
	- Depreciation → Exports are cheaper and imports more expensive
	- Appreciation → Imports are cheaper and exports more expensive
- Protectionism
	- Tariffs → reduces import volume
- Real income
- Non-price factors
	- Export competitiveness
	- Innovation
	- Labor costs
	- Infrastructure
	- Productivity
