### Inflation

There are multiple measures of inflation within economies, and the most commonly used one is the **Consumer Price Index** (CPI), which measures household [[Purchasing power|purchasing power]]. Using such indexes have their limitations, the main being that the results are only indicative of the *average* household.

Another measure of inflation is the **Retail Price Index** (RPI), which includes housing costs, such as payments on mortgage interest and council tax.

#### Causes of inflation
**[[Demand-pull inflation]]**
- When [[Aggregate Demand|aggregate demand]] is growing unsustainably, the *pressure* on resources increases (“inflationary pressures”), and producers increase their prices
- Depreciations in the [[Exchange rates|exchange rate]] cause imports to become more expensive, whilst exports become cheaper, causing [[Aggregate Demand|AD]] to rise as the marginal propensity to consume increases and consumption rises
- Fiscal stimulus in the form of reduced taxes or increased government spending. This increases disposable income, increasing consumption
- Lower interest rates make saving less attractive and borrowing less expensive, so consumer spending increases
**[[Cost-push inflation]]**
- [[Trade Unions|Trade union]] power could increase labour prices, raising production costs for firms
- Indirect taxes could increase the cost of goods such as cigarettes, and producers may pass the cost onto the consumer
- Depreciations in the [[Exchange rates|exchange rate]] would cause imports to become more expensive, raising the price of raw materials and thereby increasing the cost of production 
- As global commodity prices rise, raw materials become more expensive and the cost of production increases

#### Effects of inflation
**Firms**
- When inflation is high, interest rates are likely to be high. This means the cost of borrowing and investing is higher, and the volume of investments decreases
- Workers demand higher wages, further increasing costs of production
- Firms can lose international competitiveness if they have to increase the price of their products to maintain profits

**Workers**
- Real income falls with inflation, so disposable income falls
- As cost of production increases for firms, they may lay off unnecessary labor to cut costs, leading to [[Employment and unemployment|unemployment]] increasing

**Consumers**
- Low income consumers are hit hardest as the cost of necessities increases and the [[Purchasing power|purchasing power]] of their money falls
