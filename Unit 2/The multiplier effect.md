The multiplier effect occurs when there is new demand in the economy. This leads to an injection of more income into the circular flow of income, which leads to [[Economic Growth|economic growth]]. This leads to *more* jobs being created, higher average incomes, more spending, and eventually, **more income is created**.

The effect is essentially the compounding of an initial increase in [[Aggregate Demand|AD]] leading to an even bigger increase in national income.

**The effects of marginal propensity on the multiplier**
- Marginal propensity to consume
	- The higher the MPC, the bigger the multiplier
- Marginal propensity to save
	- If saving is greater than consumption, the multiplier is smaller
- Marginal propensity to import
	- If consumer demand is diverted to imports, then income is withdrawn from the [[Circular flow of income|circular flow of income]] and the size of the multiplier reduces

**Calculating the multiplier**
$$
\text{Multiplier} = \frac{1}{1-\text{MPC}}
$$
$$
\text{Marginal propensity to withdraw} = \text{MPS} + \text{MPT} + \text{MPM}
$$
$$
\text{Multiplier} = \frac{1}{\text{MPW}}
$$
