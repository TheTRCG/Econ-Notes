**The importance of [[Trade and the world economy|trade]] for economic growth**
- Exports generate large revenue and bring in foreign exchange
- When economies grow via export revenue, we call this [[export led economic growth]]

**Economic growth and [[Inflation|inflation]]**
- [[Demand-pull inflation]] can occur as demand in the economy rises faster than supply
- [[Cost-push inflation]] can also occur as economic growth pushes up the price for resources
- However, the effects of inflation will be reduced if [[Aggregate Supply|aggregate supply]] also increases
