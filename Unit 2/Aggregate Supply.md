The relationship between an economies price level and the quantity of goods supplied by its producers can be represented by the SRAS and LRAS curves.
It also reflects the quantity of [[Gross Domestic Product|real GDP]] that is supplied at different price levels in the economy.

#### Short run aggregate supply
This curve shows that with an increase in the national price level, there is na increase in the amount of output that firms are willing to supply.

#### Long run aggregate supply
In the long run, it’s assumed that an economy will move towards an equilibrium where all resources are being used to full capacity.
The LRAS curve is vertical as an increase in the price level **won’t cause an increase in output** because the economy is already at full capacity and cannot increase output.
